# Getting Started with  App Rick and Morty

This project was bootstrapped with [Rick and Morty App](https://github.com/JamesWhite10/rick_and_morty).

In order to run my application on a local host, you need very little:
1. You need to follow the link that I indicated a little higher.
2. Download the project archive, or install it yourself using the git clone command.
3. Then install all required dependencies yarn install / npm install.
4. And you can start the application with confidence with the command yarn start / npm start.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
